Homework 1 -  HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Description

This assignment was focused on taking an existing marketing web page and making it more accessible. It solves the problems of reducing the risk of litgation for the company, increases the chances that the page will appear as search engine results, and makes the world a little more accessible. 

I learned that including multiple css selectors without a comma is basically a way of styling specific elements. It helps skirt around the "for all h1 elements" statements.
